# dotfiles
my dotfiles
first time I am writing a README.md file.
basically an introduction for myself whenever I format my system.

# before everything
* Download 
  * git
  * etc...

## nvim (text editor)
nvim just seems a better choice now. Maybe nano for a backup just in case nvim breaks or even vi
```
sudo pacman -S neovim
```
config files for neovim 
```
git clone https://github.com/Johnsonnn64/
```

## DWM (window manager)
the repo Johnsonnn64/iamcahd is my DWM 

```
git clone https://github.com/Johnsonnn64/iamcahd ~/.config/iamchad
```
